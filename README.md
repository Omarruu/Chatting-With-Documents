# Chatting-With-Documents
This project enables users to interact with their documents through natural language using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
Built with the LlamaIndex framework, it supports querying content from PDFs and Word documents using powerful language models like Google PaLM and embeddings from Hugging Face.

Key Features:

  - Built with LlamaIndex for document ingestion, indexing, and retrieval
  - Supports PDF and DOCX files using pypdf and docx2txt
  - Uses Google PaLM (via google-generativeai) for high-quality generation
  - Integrates Hugging Face Transformers and sentence-transformers for embeddings
  - Optionally uses LangChain Community Tools and llama-index-embeddings-langchain for flexible embedding pipelines
  - Ideal for querying research papers, reports, manuals, and more
